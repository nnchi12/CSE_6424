Description:
In this project, we build an interactive Tableau dashboard for online grocery shopping recommendation. 
Our interface contains two parts: the welcome page with title "Welcome to Time-Based Smart Product Recommendation" and the blue button "Go to Your Business Account" takes users to our dashboard "Time-Based Product Recommendation Dashboard" 

The dashboard consists of 4 different sections, filters for user_id, department and product_id for customized filtering of certain customer shopping behavior. The heat map is shows optimal shopping time, we have hour of day as x-axis and 7 weekdays as y-axis. Users can hover over to the timeframe and it will show the time to shop and count of items. The bubble graph shows different customer groups. The right half of the dashboard detailed out the department, product_id, and product names. All sections will update upon filter application or timeframe selection.
